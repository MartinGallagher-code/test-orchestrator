# following it makes every test function below look unreachable, since
# run_test invokes them by name.
# A job's command is single-quoted throughout this file on purpose: it has
# to reach the far side unexpanded, so that $TX_OUT means the out
# directory on the host rather than an empty variable in this shell. That
# non-expansion is SC2016's whole warning and is the behaviour under test.
