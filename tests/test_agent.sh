# The agent: the half of tx that runs on the servers. It is what makes a
# job's result a result -- the environment it runs in, the bound it runs
# under, and the record it leaves behind.

# The helper is deliberately not declared with `# shellcheck source=`:
# following it makes every test function below look unreachable, since
# run_test invokes them by name.
# A job's command is single-quoted throughout this file on purpose: it has
# to reach the far side unexpanded, so that $TX_OUT means the out
# directory on the host rather than an empty variable in this shell. That
# non-expansion is SC2016's whole warning and is the behaviour under test.
